# node-shoom

node-shoom exposes the functionality of [shoom](https://github.com/itchio/shoom) to
node.js apps, such as: creating shared memory objets, writing to them and reading from them.

It builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Usage

A code sample here would look great, but code samples in README tend to
get out-of-sync with actual code.

Instead, head over to the [tests](https://github.com/itchio/node-shoom/tree/master/test) -
they're simple, promised!

## License

node-shoom is released under the MIT license, see the `LICENSE` file.
