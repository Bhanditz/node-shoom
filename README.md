# capsule-videosink

capsule-videosink is a nodejs addon that plays a role in sending
video frames from an electron app to [capsule](https://github.com/itchio/capsule).

It doesn't concern itself with the capsule wire format over named pipes,
it only deals with the "copying frame buffers to shared memory" part.
